# Final Project Deliverable 1

This app is created to help people cook with the ingredients they already have in their house, but also suggests what they can pick up from the grocery store to complete a certain meal (if they so choose). This includes time constraints, to only show recipes that can be made within a certain amount of time for the user. It also allows the users to save recipes so they can view it later when they want to make the same meal again.

This app is valuable because it helps many people learn how to cook a great meal with what they already have in their house, in addition to considering the amount of time the user only has to cook, if they have a busy lifestyle.
